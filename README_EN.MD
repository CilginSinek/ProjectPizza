# Classic Italian Pizza Recipe

## Ingredients for Pizza Dough
- 500g flour (type 00 or all-purpose)
- 300ml warm water
- 10g fresh yeast (or 1 packet dry yeast)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar

## Ingredients for Pizza Sauce
- 400g canned tomatoes (crushed or pureed)
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt, black pepper

## Toppings
- 250g mozzarella cheese (shredded or sliced)
- Fresh basil leaves
- Optional: salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, bell peppers

## Making the Dough

1. **Activate the yeast**: In a small bowl, add yeast and sugar to warm water. Wait 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.

2. **Knead the dough**: In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix with a spoon first, then knead by hand until you get a soft and elastic dough (8-10 minutes).

3. **Let it rise**: Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth. Let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in size.

## Preparing the Sauce

1. Heat olive oil in a pan.
2. Sauté minced garlic for 1 minute.
3. Add tomatoes, spices, salt and pepper.
4. Cook over medium heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken.

## Making the Pizza

1. **Preheat the oven**: Heat your oven to maximum temperature (250-280°C / 480-540°F). If using a pizza stone, heat it in the oven too.

2. **Shape the dough**: Divide the risen dough into 2-3 equal portions. Roll each one out on a lightly floured surface with your hands or a rolling pin into a circle (about 30cm diameter, thin).

3. **Add sauce**: Spread pizza sauce on the dough base, leaving the edges clear.

4. **Add toppings**: Add mozzarella cheese and other toppings. Don't overload - too many toppings will make it soggy.

5. **Bake**: Place the pizza on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the edges are golden and cheese is melted.

6. **Serve**: Add fresh basil leaves when it comes out of the oven. Serve hot.

## Tips
- For better flavor, let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator
- Using a pizza stone gives a crispier result
- Don't add too many toppings or the pizza will get soggy
- Make sure to preheat your oven thoroughly for best results

Enjoy! 🍕
